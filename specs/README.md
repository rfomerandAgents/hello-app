# Specifications

This directory contains specification documents at different abstraction levels.

## Directory Structure

- `high-level/` - Business requirements, user stories, conceptual designs
- `medium-level/` - Architecture designs, component specifications, API contracts
- `low-level/` - Detailed implementation plans, code-level specifications

## Usage

1. Create high-level spec first (what to build, why)
2. Create medium-level spec (how to architect it)
3. Create low-level spec (detailed implementation plan)
4. Use specs as input for /feature, /bug, /chore commands
